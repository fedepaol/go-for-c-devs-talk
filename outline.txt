Outline
- Why I wanted to learn go
  expectations
  intro to C
  what I found

Go vs C as a language
	types (base, composite)
	memory management / pointers
	functions (and error handling)

Less ways to shoot in your foot

OOP
	Encapsulation
	Mention reflection


Concurrency:
	Goroutines
	Mutexes & co

Facilities:
        zero values
	no implicit casting
	defer
	unused imports / variables
	_ to ignore 
	named returns
	assegnamento in if

Go vs C: tooling
	standard library
	dependency management (single executable, go get)
	go tool, profiling, fmt, race detector, test

CGO:
	interaction between C and Go

Conclusion

memory efficient (no boxing, locality)
