* About me

- Lead developer at List
- Android Developer
- Not a Go expert
- Know some python

* Why I started this journey

We do distributed systems, and we (also) use C

Go's elevator pitch:

- fast
- good at networking and multiprocessing
- scales well

* On top of that, Go claims to be

- comprehensible
- statically typed
- fast to work in
- doesn't require tools, but supports them well

* Let's talk about C
: niche use cases
: the "latin" of programming languages

* Very simple

You have Structs
.code structs.c

and functions
.code functions.c

and that's it.
No objects, inheritance, polymorphism.

* Oh, and you have pointers
.code pointers.c
Direct access to memory locations. 
It's only way to pass references around instead of copies.

* What I like about C
- direct control of things (pointers!)
- no hidden costs
- *you*understand*what*you*are*reading*

* What I don't like about C
- *verbose*
- easy to shoot on your foot
- limited standard library
- dependency management

*Do*we*always*need*that*kind*of*control?*

: memory leaks, direct access to memory
: if you need a data structure, you need to reimplement it or rely on external libraries

* The recipe for Go

- Go back to the 70s / 80s and find a bunch of great programmers. Say, Ken Thompson, Rob Pike, people like that. Marinate them in Bell Labs for 30 years, during which time they code in C, keep developing Unix, invent Plan 9, UTF-8, and other wonderful things.

- Take them out, seduce them with Python, wow them with Google-scale computing. Add more amazing programmers (Brad Fitzpatrick for example), stir in Googleâ€™s near-unlimited resources.

- Ask them how they would do C now, if they could start from scratch.

* What I did expect from Go

* Other languages I (barely) know
Kotlin

Javascript

Java

* Doing a lot with few lines of code

: languages as products. They copy each others and keep adding features
: Too dense!

* What I found

Simple apply/filter/reduce package by Rob Pike:

.link https://github.com/robpike/filter

From the repo readme:
I wanted to see how hard it was to implement this sort of thing in Go, with as nice an API as I could manage. It wasn't hard.
Having written it a couple of years ago, I haven't had occasion to use it once.
 *Instead*,*I*just*use*"for"*loops.*
You shouldn't use it either.

* Go focuses on
- being explicit rather than implicit
- being readable
- getting sh*t done

* Let's dive in

* Basic data types

As in C, we do have integers, floats, booleans:
.code basictypes.go

Go provides a higher level _string_ type:

.code strings.go

Implicit casts are not allowed

.code basictypes2.go

* Composite data types:

- arrays
- slices
- maps
- structs

* Arrays in C:
.code arrays.c

- length is not a property
- shortcut for pointer arithmetic (non initialized, out of bound errors write in memory)

* Arrays in Go: 
.code arrays.go

- Fixed lenght
- Passed by value

* Slices
.code slices.go

- Backed by arrays
- Resized by append
- Holds a reference of the underlying array

Can be iterated:

.code sliceiterate.go

* Maps 
Maps are the most abused and useful data structure.

.code maps.go

- no native equivalent in C
- they hold a reference to the data
- also used as sets

Can be iterated too:

.code mapiterate.go


* Memory management in C

- heap vs stack
.code malloc.c

- efficient
- the dev is in control of what lives in the stack and what in the heap
- easy to forget the lifecycle of malloc'ed objects

* Memory management in C

*The*most*effective*way*to*shoot*in*your*foot*

* Memory management in Go

There are pointers too, which is good: the dev is in control of what is passed by value and what by reference 

.code pointers.go

- using escape analysis, the compiler chooses what to leave on the stack and what on the heap
- garbage collected
- pointers are references to live objects: there is no way to mess up with the memory
: differenza con altri linguaggi dove tutto e` per reference 
: no boxing

* Functions

.code functions.go

- multiple return values (error handling)
- first class values
- can be anonymous

.code closure.go

* Let's talk about OOP

* User defined data structures
C structs:
.code structs.c
Go Structs
.code struct.go

* No classes in Go

_If_C++_and_Java_are_about_type_hierarchies_and_the_taxonomy_of_types,_Go_is_about_composition._ (Rob Pike)

.code embedding.go

* Go structures vs classes

- no inheritance
- no generics
- enforce composition

.image eighties.jpg 400 _

* Methods

- Just a special kind of functions (they have a receiver)
- Explicitly associated to objects or pointers

.code methods.go

; can assign methods to any type, even those you don't own

* Interfaces

- Abstract types defining a behaviour
- Satisfied implicitly 

.code interface.go

- Can be checked

.code interfaceassertion.go

* In C
_void*_ is the passpartout

You can cast anything to anything else, so nobody checks 


: you can retro assign an interface to any object
